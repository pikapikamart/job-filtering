## My process

Hello this is my twelfth challenge submission here in front end mentor and this was a fun challenge for me. I got late in my everyday fronendmentor since my study started yesterday, you know, school. But hey, I managed to do it and I really liked it. Hope you to as well^

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- FlexBox
- Javascript
- Sass preprocessor

I said that I won't use any frameworks and build it from scratch to be more exciting and challenging

### What I learned

Working with JSON file are definitely the best choice in every challenge that requires dynamic implementation

### Continued development

I want to focus more on creating more complex designs and also designing things on my own time
